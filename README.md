# Flower-Species-Prediction

A Convolutional Neural Network That Predicts The Species of flowers based on these five classes:
1. Daisy
2. Sunflower
3. Rose
4. Tulip
5. Dandelion

The architecture used to build the model is the [TINY VGG](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) used in the [CNN Explainer](https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/) Website.

The Flower Recognition.ipynb file is the raw notebook, which has my end-to-end workflow for exploring, visualizing and transforming the data, Building and fitting the model and finding the appropriate hyperparameters.
